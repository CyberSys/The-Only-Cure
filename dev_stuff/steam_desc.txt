[h1]You're bitten. You have two choices.[/h1]
Wait until you succumb to the virus or take matters into your hands. Cut off that infected part and live to die another day.

This version of [b]The Only Cure[/b] has been rebuilt from scratch to support future additions and to feel as close as possible as a vanilla mechanic.

[b]If you're using an older version of The Only Cure and want to switch with this, you're gonna need to create a new character\save to prevent issues.[/b]
[b]The older version will be delisted shortly and it will not be supported anymore.[/b]
[h1]Supports [b]Single Player[/b] and [b]Multiplayer[/b]. Host Mode is currently [b]UNSUPPORTED![/b][/h1]

[h1]Setup[/h1]
Use it with the following mods for the intended experience:
[list]

[/list]

Place them [b]BEFORE[/b] The Only Cure in your mod list!

[h1]Quick guide[/h1]
[h2]Amputation[/h2]
Get a [i]Saw[/i] or a [i]Garden Saw[/i], right click on it, and choose which limb to amputate. You can also drag n' drop your Saw item directly into the afflicted area to start cutting it off.

If you have some [i]bandages[/i] and\or [i]stitches[/i] in your inventory you will automatically use them, multiplying the chances of your survival.
If you have a [i]tourniquet[/i], place it on the correct side to dampen the amount of damage you will take after you're done amputating the limb.

Keep in mind that if you amputate your [b]upper arm[/b], you won't be able to equip any prosthesis.

After you've amputated a limb, you will gain [b]skill points[/b] for the amputated side, making timed actions faster in due time.

[h2]Cicatrization[/h2]
You can check the cicatrization status of an amputated limb from your [b]Health Panel[/b]
From time to time, you should clean your wounds with a bandage to help the cicatrization process.
If your limb isn't completely cicatrized, you can still equip prosthetic limbs, but that can trigger random bleedings from that area.

[h2]Prosthetics[/h2]
If you're missing a hand, you won't be able to do a lot of things, such as equipping two-handed weapons. With prosthetics limbs, you can fix that.
There are two prosthesis type that can be crafted\found in medical areas:
[list]
[*] Hook Prosthesis
[*] Arm Prosthesis
[/list]

The main difference between the twos is that your actions will take longer with the Hook Prosthesis.
When you equip a prosthetic limb, you will slowly gain skill points in the [b]Prosthesis Familiarity[/b] perk, making actions more speedy in due time.

[h2]Admin tools[/h2]
If something strange happened, an admin can reset TOC mechanics on any player by right clicking on them and select [i]"Reset Amputations"[/i]. They could also do the opposite by clicking on [i]"Force Amputation"[/i] for each amputable limb.
